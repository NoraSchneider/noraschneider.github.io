I am a PhD Student in Machine Learning at [Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai/) and [TU Munich](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/cs/home/), jointly supervised by [Niki Kilbertus](https://sites.google.com/view/nikikilbertus/home) and [Mihaela van der Schaar](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/prof-mihaela-van-der-schaar/). I am also part of the [ELLIS PhD program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc). My research focuses on leveraging causality to address current challenges in machine learning, with a particular emphasis on dynamical systems and their applications in biology and healthcare.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a Master's in Data Science from [ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch/). For my master's thesis, I worked on causal discovery under the supervision of [Prof. Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea). Additionally, I completed a research project on data augmentation for regression using concepts from causality at the [Swiss Data Science Center](https://www.datascience.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Fernando Perez-Cruz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-perez-cruz-930610b?originalSubdomain=ch).

Feel free to reach out for potential collaborations or questions about my work!
